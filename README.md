This project explores **Major League Baseball (MLB)** team statistics from **1871â€“2015** to uncover how offensive efficiency, pitching control, and historical trends influence team success and fan engagement.  
The dataset includes team-level performance metrics (wins, runs, hits, ERA, strikeouts, attendance, etc.) and has been cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using a structured data analytics pipeline.

The ultimate goal was to translate baseball performance metrics into **business-relevant insights**, connecting on-field success to off-field outcomes such as attendance and revenue potential.  
The project replicates the structure of a professional analytics workflow: 

|**Data Quality Assessment** | Identify missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies | Completeness checks, IQR, type coercion |
| **Data Cleaning** | Improve data validity while preserving analytical value | Median/mode imputation, IQR capping, normalization |
| **Feature Engineering** | Create meaningful analytical variables | Offensive Efficiency, Pitching Control, Attendance per Win, Performance Tier |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis** | Visualize trends, correlations, and patterns | Histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, heatmaps, trendlines |
| **Business Insights** | Translate statistical results into real-world implications | Executive Summary, Findings, Recommendations |
